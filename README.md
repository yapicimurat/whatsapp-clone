# WhatsApp-Clone Web Project
### Why did i developed this project?
I developed this project for improve my system designing and coding skills.
And also I didn't want to think about finding any project to develop. 
I wanted to find ready project and I decided to develop WhatsApp clone.

Absolutely, there are no perfect system design and frameworks in my clone project that I used for.
But I'm learning new technologies and new techniques day by day.
I'll be added new technologies in the future such as RabbitMQ, redis etc.
For now,
* React JS
* Socket.io
* Express JS
* MongoDB
* Redux Toolkit
I used above technologies...
